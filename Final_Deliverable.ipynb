The first hypothesis test done was to test the relationship between nativeness and abundance. This is important for the health of the parks since we would like to see that native species are more abundant than non-native species. We concluded that there was indeed a difference between the abundance of native vs non-native species.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second test done was the chi squared test on species category and the presence of each category. We want to see around an even distribution of presence in each category; however, this is not what we saw. One design flaw that occured, though, is that we used presence as a count instead of a percentage, so some presence counts were skewed simply because there were more of those species listed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final test done was the ANOVA on the region that the park was in and the nativeness in those parks. We found that the park region does have an affect on the the percentage of native species in the park. To further look into this we would have to do individual hypothesis tests on the regions to determine which regions specifically have a different native percentage."

In particular, we will train a Random Forest Classifier model to predict a species' conservation status based upon its category, order, abundance, and seasonality. When a new species emerges or is discovered within the park, in areas nearby, or in different areas altogether, such a model can identify whether it is at risk of being endangered."

Ideally, we would've liked the model to perform well in all the categories, but the fact that it did really well at identifying the main non-endangered category (Species of Concern) shows that it is strong at predicting whether or not a species is close to being endangered, even though it is weak at predicting the exact endangered level when the species is close to being endangered."

        "As seen in the graph, the family feature in the dataset has the highest importance when predicting a species' conservation status. Order and seasonality also have an aggregated importance score of greater than 0.1, indicating that they are somewhat important as well for the prediction model. The significance of this graph is that we are able to pinpoint what features to look at to more accurately predict whether or not a species will become endangered; we now know that the type of species plays a big role in whether or not they are close to becoming endangered, and the seasonality of the species also plays a big role. Because we now know the general features of a species that determines their conservation status, we can hopefully use these types of models in the future to predict whether or not a species is in need of help in order to avoid endangerment."

        "# **Insights and Conclusions**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal for this tutorial was to study the impact of type, origin, and behaviour on the conservation status of a species over National Parks in the US.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS**\n",
        "\n",
        "After some data cleaning, we performed several statistical tests as part of our exploratory analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first was an independent T-test to check if the amount of non-native species was significantly different than native species. Through this test, we found that the difference between the two groups is, in fact, significantly different.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second test was a chi-squared test to check if the category of a species affected whether it was present in a certain park or not. Again, through our test, we were able to conclude that the category of a species does play a role in its presence in a national park (Though, it should be mentioned that our test used a raw number rather than a percentage, which could have skewed our results).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we used an ANOVA test to check if the location of the park affected the percentage of native species in the park. This, again, returned to us a result that told us that park region does have an effect on the percentage of native species there. While we could have run further hypothesis tests to determine which specific regions have a different native species percentage, we elected not to as we felt it was not necessary for our study.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "**MACHINE LEARNING MODEL**\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to complete our goal and allow others to gain an understanding for the effect of a species' attributes on its conservation status, we decided to use a Random Forest Classifier model. Through use of this, we were able to create a model that was able to predict whether a species was endangered based off its attributes with 90% accuracy. However, it was more flawed when trying to predict how endangered the species was - this is something that we would like to look into fixing moving forward. Overall, however, our model did a good job at accomplishing our goal: based off of a species' attributes, predict whether or not it is endangered.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "**OVERALL CONCLUSIONS AND MOVING FORWARD**\n",
        "\n",
        "The conclusions from our research can be used to achieve a much greater understanding of what classifies a species as endangered in the US National Parks. This can be helpful in determining whether unlisted or newly introduced species should also be classified as endangered. Classifying species as endangered can help identify which species need more help, and because of this we are able to give our best efforts towards preventing species from become extinct.Furthermore, our machine learning model will allow for further efficiency in making this conclusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the future, we would like to explore methods to make our Random Forest Classifier model more accurate at predicting exactly how endangered a species is. Furthermore, we would like to explore other factors that may affect the level of endangerment of a species, as well as parks and other areas outside of the US."
